        <p> The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
        The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. 
        A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.
        Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. 
        The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. </p>

            It was always the Monday mornings. 
            It never seemed to happen on Tuesday morning, Wednesday morning, or any other morning during the week. 
            But it happened every Monday morning like clockwork. He mentally prepared himself to once again deal with what was about to happen,
            but this time he also placed a knife in his pocket just in case.

            MaryLou wore the tiara with pride. 
            There was something that made doing anything she didn't really want to do a bit easier when she wore it. 
            She really didn't care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment.

            Here's the thing. She doesn't have anything to prove, but she is going to anyway.
            That's just her character. She knows she doesn't have to, but she still will just to show you that she can. 
            Doubt her more and she'll prove she can again. We all already know this and you will too.
